      <h3>Important Notes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Educational Use Only:</strong> This application is intended <strong>solely for research and educational purposes</strong>. It analyzes previously captured PCAP files and is <strong>not</strong> designed for real-time monitoring or deployment on live medical systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy & Legal Notice:</strong> Please avoid uploading PCAP files containing real patient data, personal identifiers, or confidential information. Processing PHI (Protected Health Information) without authorization may violate privacy laws.</li>
        <li><strong>HL7 Traffic Focus:</strong> The analyzer detects anomalies in <strong>unencrypted HL7 medical network traffic</strong> (segments such as <code>MSH|</code>, <code>PID|</code>, <code>OBR|</code>). It identifies patterns that may indicate replay, data exfiltration, or traffic spikes.</li>
        <li><strong>Encrypted Traffic:</strong> Encrypted packets are <strong>intentionally excluded</strong> from analysis, as decryption would require access to private keys or interception methods outside the ethical and technical scope of this project.</li>
        <li><strong>Unencrypted HL7 Alerts:</strong> These alerts appear whenever plaintext HL7-like content is detected without TLS/SSL encryption. This does <strong>not</strong> indicate an error — it simply confirms that readable HL7 traffic was found. Because the analyzer ignores encrypted packets, this alert will <strong>almost always trigger</strong> when processing real HL7 data.</li>
        <li><strong>Detection Method:</strong> Pattern-based detection (keyword and segment matching) is used instead of full HL7 protocol parsing. This design keeps the tool lightweight but may produce false positives when non-HL7 traffic contains similar text patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Limitations & Future Work:</strong> DICOM (medical imaging) traffic is not analyzed in the current version. Future updates aim to add optional parsing for DICOM-based systems (e.g., PACS servers) to detect insecure image transfers.</li>
      </ul>
